This is where I store all the files for "Enter The Wormhole" Unity 3D game.

Currently on itch.io and soon to be on the Steam store in September 2017. 

## Development Note
I am open sourcing this game and anyone can take this and make it into their own version. For more information, please do not hesitate to contact me @ecstatic_c on Twitter or on github.

Most Assets are made with Google Blocks, one bubble effect is made with Google Tilt Brush, the only other three are from the Unity Asset Store.
